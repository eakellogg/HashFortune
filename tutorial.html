            HashFortune Tutorial

        <p>
        Howdy!  Thank you for playing our game.  Until we set up a more thorough tutorial, here is a brief description of how to play HashFortune, which we will try to update regularly.

        <b>How to play the game: (please read this section)</b>
        HashFortune is a pseudo-stock market based on twitter hashtags.  We do get real data from Twitter, and update everything accordingly.  The general idea is that you can invest points into any hashtags, and the goal is to do so before they get popular.  The value of your investment will be updated every hour (when our twitter data is updated).  If you buy 1000 of #tbt when 2 other people are invested and it was tweeted 30 times that hour, if the next hour more people have invested in it or it was used more than 30 times, then the value of your investment will go up.  Likewise, if it has less investors or was tweeted less times, the value of your investment will go down.

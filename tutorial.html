        Howdy!  Welcome to HashFortune!
        </p>
        
	
		
        <p>
        <b>General Instructions</b> 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		HashFortune is a game based on buying and sellings stocks based on real Twitter hashtags.  Our databases pull hashtags from Twitter each hour, giving you up to date info on the latest trends. <br>
		The goal of the game is to buy and sell stocks in hashtags.  Investing wisely will increase your net worth and help you rise on the leaderboard.  
		The value of a stock increases both when more shares are bought and when the hashtag appears more on Twitter.  So the goal is to invest in a hashtag before it gets popular, and sell it at a peak time for maximum profit.
        </p>

		<b>Some Basics</b>
		<ul>
		<li> Initially, you will start with 5,000 points to invest as you wish.</li>
		<li>The initial price of a stock in any hashtag is 20, and this will rise and fall based on the number of shares bought and the hashtag's actual popularity on Twitter.</li>
		<li>Hashtag stock values will vary immediately in response to a change in the number of shares bought.  The value will also be updated hourly based on Twitter popularity.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Fun Features</b>
